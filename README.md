Big Data Q&A
============

What is in this repo?

- This contains notes that I made while teaching Hadoop, Spark and
    other Big Data technologies

- These are based on questions that came up in classes.

Why should I read this?

- If you are planning to teach Hadoop or Spark these notes can be
    useful in preparing for your classes.

- If you are preparing for certification exams these can help give you
    more material to prep on.

- If you are planning to use Hadoop or Spark in production these cover
    caveats and use cases you might encounter.
