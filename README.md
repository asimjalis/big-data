Big Data Q&A
============

What is in this repo?

- Notes I made teaching Hadoop, Spark and other Big Data technologies.

- Questions that came up in classes and answers.

Why should I read this?

- If you are planning to teach Hadoop or Spark these notes can help
    you prepare.

- If you are planning to take a certification exam they can
    give you an edge.

- If you are planning to use Hadoop or Spark in production they can
    illustrate caveats and use cases you will encounter.
